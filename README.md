## Important Note

We used VS Code as our IDE for this project, therefore the project contains a .vscode file, specifying where to access the db2jcc4.jar file. 
If another IDE is used to run this project, you may need to add configurations so that the program can locate any imported libraries.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
